This folder contains scripts that can be used to customize the public tranSMART code base.

For each change made, consider first whether the change might be of interest to the 
tranSMART community and if so, create a pull request to the official tranSMART repo. Things like bug 
fixes and new functionalities should be handled as such.

In some cases, this might not make sense, such as customising the color scheme. The scripts in this folder are 
meant to be used to apply such changes on top of the public tranSMART code base.
